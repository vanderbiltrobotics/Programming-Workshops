# Meeting Schedule

The overall goal for this semester is to get everyone the skills necessary to contribute to one of the major programming tasks that will need to be completed for the competition robot. That way, once the robot is ready to be programmed, none of those tasks will seem too daunting as we'll have solved similar problems already.

Each week, 1-2 meetings will be devoted to learning about some robotics programming topic that may be applicable to the competition robot. The other 1-2 meetings will be spent working in sub-teams on a specific problem related to the robot. 

Before each of the workshop-style meetings, I'll add a link in the calendar to a written walkthough for the lesson
