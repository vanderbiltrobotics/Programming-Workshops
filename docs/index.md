Meeting Schedule
================

Everything on here is tentative but the next few weeks should generally be accurate. This is a fairly optimistic timeline and I expect things to get pushed back a little, but I think we will be able to keep up  pretty well. 

The overall goal for this semester is to get everyone the skills necessary to contribute to one of the major programming tasks that will need to be completed for the competition robot. That way, once the robot is ready to be programmed, none of those tasks will seem too daunting as we'll have solved similar problems already.

Before each meeting, I'll add a link in the calendar to a written walkthough for the lesson.
